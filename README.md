# PageRank-algorithm-using-Eigonfactor-values

###This python implementation is a slight variation of the PageRank algorithm, which uses Eigonfactor values for ranking nodes/pages. 

###Input:
###Takes an edge list as its input. An edge list is a csv file containing 3 columns - from node, to node and weight for edges (or number of citations)
###for 'from node' to the 'to node'.
###The default input is an edge list containing 4 million edges amongst 11 thousand nodes.

###utput:
###Produces the top 20 pages by popularity in descending order and corresponding eigonfactor values.
